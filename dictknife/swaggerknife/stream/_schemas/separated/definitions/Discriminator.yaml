  Discriminator:
    description: When request bodies or response payloads may be one of a number of
      different schemas, a `discriminator` object can be used to aid in serialization,
      deserialization, and validation.  The discriminator is a specific object in
      a schema which is used to inform the consumer of the specification of an alternative
      schema based on the value associated with it.  Note, when using the discriminator,
      _inline_ schemas will not be considered when using the discriminator.
