### Refactor: Enhance Docstrings in `dictknife/commands/dictknife.py`

**Description:**

The docstrings in `dictknife/commands/dictknife.py` need to be comprehensively reviewed and updated to ensure clarity, consistency, and completeness. This will improve maintainability and usability of the module, particularly for the CLI commands it defines.

**LLM Prompt for Docstring Generation:**

```
Analyze the Python code in `dictknife/commands/dictknife.py`. Your task is to review, update, and generate comprehensive docstrings for all classes, methods, and functions within this file.

**Key Requirements:**

*   **Completeness:** Ensure every class, method, and function has a docstring. This includes the main CLI dispatch function (`main`) and individual command functions (`cat`, `transform`, `diff`, `shape`, `shrink`, `mkdict`), as well as any helper functions like `_open`.
*   **Clarity:** Docstrings should clearly explain the purpose of the code element. For CLI command functions, explain what the command does.
*   **Parameters:** Document all arguments, including their expected types and purpose. For methods, document `self` if conventional for the chosen style. For CLI command functions, ensure all command-line arguments (as function parameters) are documented, including their choices if applicable (e.g., `merge_method` for `cat`, `output_format` for `diff`).
*   **Return Values:** Document what the function/method returns, including the type. If nothing is returned (e.g., for functions that primarily have side effects like printing to stdout or writing files), explicitly state that.
*   **Exceptions:** Document any common exceptions that the code might raise.
*   **Formatting:** Format the docstrings using reStructuredText, suitable for Sphinx.
*   **Usage Examples:** Include concise usage examples in docstrings for public functions/methods, especially the CLI command functions, where it aids understanding. Examples should show how to use the command or function.
*   **Special Attention:** Pay special attention to documenting the parameters of the CLI command functions (e.g., `cat`, `transform`, `diff`, `shape`, `shrink`, `mkdict`), detailing what each parameter does and any available choices or defaults. This was noted as an area needing improvement. Also, ensure module-level and helper function docstrings are present and informative.

**File to Process:** `dictknife/commands/dictknife.py`

Please provide the updated Python code with the new and revised docstrings.
